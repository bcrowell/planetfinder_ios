Hi Ben,

The code that I wrote has always been available under BSD-license.

Because in early versions of star3map, I used the GPL'd planet-finder code, all the code was available under GPL terms, but
+individually, the source files I wrote could be used with the BSD license.

Newer versions of star3map (now called Space Junk) use none of the original GPL'd code at all.  It has been completely removed,
+and when that was done, I also closed the source.
